# Flip-Socket

A real-time multiplayer game platform built with a full-stack WebSocket architecture — from local development to live production. Currently ships with **Coin Flip**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Rock Paper Scissors**, and **High / Low**, with the codebase structured so that adding a new game type requires touching only the game files themselves.

## How it works

Players create a room, others join from the lobby, and everyone plays together in real time. The server owns all game state and broadcasts updates to the room after every action.

```
Player A ──┐
Player B ──┼──► Server (Socket.io) ──► game logic ──► broadcasts to room
Player C ──┘
```

## Features

- **Multiple games** — Coin Flip (any players), Tic-Tac-Toe (2 players), Rock Paper Scissors (2 players), High / Low card game (2 players)
- **Auto-generated room IDs** — create a room with one click; no manual ID needed
- **Open rooms lobby** — the join screen lists all active rooms in real time; click Join to enter
- **Game type selection** — the room creator picks the game mode; joiners use the host's setting
- **Score tracking** — points accumulate across rounds; the room keeps score for the session
- **Persistent nickname** — your display name is remembered when you leave and rejoin
- **Reconnection handling** — a 10-second grace period restores your slot if you lose connection
- **URL routing** — each room has its own URL (`/room/FLIP-XXXXX`); browser back button returns to the lobby

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite (TypeScript) |
| Routing | React Router v6 |
| Backend | Node.js + Express (TypeScript) |
| Real-time | Socket.io (WebSockets) |
| Deployment | Render.com |

## Project structure

Both the server and client are organized around a **game handler registry** — a pattern that lets new game types be added by dropping in one new file on each side, with zero changes to the platform code.

## Adding a new game

Adding a game means editing **exactly 4 files** and creating **2–3 new files**. Nothing in the platform layer (`server/index.ts`, `GameRoom.tsx`, `App.tsx`) needs to change.

The example below adds a hypothetical dice game.

### Files to edit

| File | What to add |
|---|---|
| `shared/types.ts` | `'dice'` to the `GameType` union + a `DiceState` interface |
| `server/games/index.ts` | `import { diceHandler } from './dice'` + `dice: diceHandler` in the registry |
| `client/src/components/games/index.ts` | `dice: lazy(() => import('./Dice'))` in the registry |
| `client/src/components/JoinRoom.tsx` | `{ value: 'dice', label: '🎲 Dice' }` in the `GAME_OPTIONS` array |

### Files to create

| File | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| `server/games/dice.ts` | A `GameHandler` object — see interface below |
| `client/src/components/games/Dice/index.tsx` | A React component that receives `GameViewProps` and renders the game UI |
| `client/src/components/games/Dice/Dice.css` | Game-specific styles |

### GameHandler interface

```typescript
// server/games/index.ts
interface GameHandler {
  roomIdPrefix: string;                              // room ID prefix, e.g. 'DICE' → room IDs like 'DICE-A1B2C'
  maxPlayers?: number;                               // cap enforced on join; omit for no limit
  onGameStart?(room: Room): void;                    // initialize gameState; called on first join and after any player leaves
  onGameInput(room: Room, player: Player, payload: unknown): void; // player sent game_input
  onGameAction(room: Room, player: Player): void;    // player sent game_action (e.g. "flip the coin")
  onPlayAgain(room: Room, player: Player): void;     // a player confirmed ready for next round
  sanitizeGameState?(state: unknown): unknown;       // strip server-only fields before broadcasting
}
```

Key rules:
- Store all game state in `room.gameState` (typed however you like — cast with `as YourState`).
- `room.gamePhase` is the platform field that drives the client UI — set it to `'choosing'`, `'ready'`, or `'result'` as the game progresses.
- The only per-player platform field game handlers may use is `player.hasActed` (set it in `onGameInput`; clear it in `onGameStart`).
- `roomIdPrefix` is the only field that drives room ID generation — `server/index.ts` reads it from the handler automatically.
- `onPlayAgain` is called once per player confirmation — track a ready-vote set inside `gameState` if all players must confirm before the next round starts.
- Use `sanitizeGameState` to strip server-only fields (e.g. the full deck, pending vote lists) before the state is sent to clients.

## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Start development servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both concurrently:
- **Backend** → `http://localhost:3001` (Express + Socket.io, via `tsx`)
- **Frontend** → `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)

> The Vite dev server proxies all `/socket.io` traffic to the backend — no CORS config needed, and the client code works identically in dev and production.

### 3. Open the app

Go to `http://localhost:5173`. Enter a nickname, pick a game, and click **Create Room**. Share the generated room code (shown in the game header) so friends can find your room in the lobby.

Vite also prints a LAN address on startup for playing across devices on the same network.

### Available scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start both server and client in watch mode |
| `npm run dev:server` | Start only the backend |
| `npm run dev:client` | Start only the frontend |
| `npm run build:client` | Build React app to `client/dist/` |
| `npm start` | Run the production server via `tsx` |

## Deploying to Render.com

The included [render.yaml](render.yaml) configures a single **Web Service** that:
1. Runs `npm install && npm run build:client` — installs deps and builds the React app
2. Runs `npm start` — serves the React static files **and** handles WebSocket connections from the same process (`tsx`, no server compilation step required)

Steps:
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New → Web Service
3. Connect your repository — Render will detect `render.yaml` automatically
4. Deploy

## Game flows

**Coin Flip** (any number of players):
```
waiting ──► choosing ──► ready ──► result
            (pick H/T)   (flip!)   (play again?)
```
1. **Waiting** — room created; fewer than 2 players
2. **Choosing** — 2+ players joined; everyone picks Heads or Tails
3. **Ready** — all players chose; anyone can click Flip
4. **Result** — coin revealed; correct guessers earn a point; Play Again resets to Choosing

**Tic-Tac-Toe** (exactly 2 players):
```
waiting ──► choosing ──► result
            (take turns)  (play again?)
```
1. **Waiting** — room created; waiting for second player
2. **Choosing** — players alternate placing X and O
3. **Result** — win or draw detected; winner earns a point; Play Again resets the board

**Rock Paper Scissors** (exactly 2 players):
```
waiting ──► choosing ──► result
            (pick R/P/S)  (play again?)
```
1. **Waiting** — room created; waiting for second player
2. **Choosing** — both players pick simultaneously; neither sees the other's choice until both have locked in
3. **Result** — choices revealed side by side; winner earns a point; Play Again resets

**High / Low** (exactly 2 players):
```
waiting ──► choosing ──► result
            (Higher/Lower)  (both ready?)
```
1. **Waiting** — room created; waiting for second player
2. **Choosing** — a card is shown face-up; both players simultaneously guess whether the next card will be Higher or Lower
3. **Result** — next card revealed; correct guessers earn a point; if both guesses are wrong or both right, either player can still earn; if ranks are equal it's a push and the next round's points double (multiplier stacks); both players must click Ready to advance
4. **Deck** — a standard 52-card deck is shared across rounds; it auto-reshuffles when exhausted
